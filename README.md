Description
-------------

Program to create pairs or small groups with users in `#unmute` Slack channel. Make human connections in digital space :computer: -- **unmute**!

######_Note: well, it sounds like this [already exists](https://www.donut.com/). Oh well, I'm writing it anyway._

Installation and Use
---------------------

* Add `unmute` as an app in your [Slack](https://slack.com/) workspace
* Create a channel named `#unmute` and add users.
* Upon joining `#unmute`, each user can choose whether they would like to have lunch in a pair (2 people) or a small group (3-4 people).
    * At any time, a user can reply to their welcome message and enter `\raincheck` to change their status to Inactive. While "rainchecked", the user will not be added to any Table. 
    * The user can enter `\connect` to set their status to Active. 
* Each Active user will receive a Direct Message on Monday morning with information regarding that week's pair or group.

Known Bugs
-----------

* It is too soon to tell, young padawan.

Road Map
---------
* Option for users to request discussion topics/conversation starters
* Automatic survey (or command) to collect session data (ie. Did you connect? Did you feel safe? Would you like to give any other feedback?)
